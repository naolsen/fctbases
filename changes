Version 0.1.4: All functions now use pass-by-reference.

Version 0.8: Major overhaul and re-implementation. Everything is much better, more easy and more correctly done. 

Version 0.8.1: Some improvements and bug fixes. Implementation of 'standard' b-spline basis.

Version 0.8.2: More improvements. Functional bases using trigonometrical identities.

Version 0.9.0: Documentation, code cleaning, small speed improvements. 

Version 0.9.2: Derivatives of first order spline. Evaluating a function with coefficients now returns a vector (previously this was a 1-col matrix).

Version 1.0.0: Derivatives of second order. Second-order derivatives have not yet been optimised for speed.

23-11-2020: Package is now available from CRAN.

Version 1.0.1: Fixed missing argument for second order derivatives, f(t,x, deriv = 2) now works. Improved documentation since 1.0.0.

Version 1.0.2: Implemented second order derivative for std.bspline.basis. Small tweaks.

Version 1.1: Matrix feature. x in f(t,x, deriv) can now be a matrix (dimensions have to match). Also included a vignette since 1.0.2.

Version 1.1.1: 2nd derivatives with coefficients for uniform b-spline. Code cleaning due to updates in Rcpp and Armadillo packages.
