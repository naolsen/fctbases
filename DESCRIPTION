Description: Easy-to-use, very fast implementation of various functional bases. Easily used together with other packages.
    A functional basis is a collection of basis functions [\phi_1, ..., \phi_n] that can represent a smooth function, i.e. $f(t) = \sum c_k \phi_k(t)$.
    First- and second-order derivatives are also included. These are the mathematically correct ones, no approximations applied.
    As of version 1.0, this package includes B-splines, Fourier bases and polynomials.
